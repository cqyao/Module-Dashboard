The idea behind this project is to create a GUI interface in which the user can add module into a Pandas database. Currecntly, the features are limited to adding modules into the database and viewing the database in whole. Planned features include searching for subject by code, filtering by grade (where grade <= 50, for example), and calculating the WAM. 

**Bugs and features should be kept in a separate changelog file.**
